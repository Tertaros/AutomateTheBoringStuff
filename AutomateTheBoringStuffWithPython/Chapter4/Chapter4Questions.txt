Practice Questions

1. What is []?
An empty list

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
'd'

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
'd'

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']
For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
for concatenation '+' and for replication '*'

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append() adds a value exclusively to the end of the list while with insert() you can determine the position with an index

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
del list[index] in array
list.remove(value)

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
They both usually contain sequences of data
like a list you can ask for a specific character in string via an index string[index]
You can use the "in" function with string and lists to search their content for something.

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
Lists are mutable while tuples are unmutable

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
(42,)

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
tuple(listvalue)
list(tuplevalue)

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
The contain a reference to the location of the value in memory

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
If the list contains lists you need to use deepcopy to fully copy it as copy does not go a level deeper.
