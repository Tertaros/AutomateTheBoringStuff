1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
- True & False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and, or and not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).
and
True and True -> True
True and False -> False
False and True -> False
False and False -> False

or
True or True -> True
True or False -> True
False or True -> True
False or False -> False

not
not True -> False
not False -> True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5 > 4) -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
(True and True) and (True == False) -> False
(not False) or (not True) -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==, !=, >, <, <=, >=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
The equal operator is made up of two symbols "==" and evaluates into either a True or False statement while the assignment operator copies the value on the right into the variable on the left.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
An expression that results in either True or False. I would use it determine if specific code needs to be executed.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0 block1
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs') block2
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') block3
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = 0
if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
CTRL+C
11. What is the difference between break and continue?
break will result in leaving the loop
continue will set the code execution back again at the beginning of the loop checking the condition

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
There is no difference

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1,11):
  print(i)

i = 1
while i<=10:
  print(i)
  i += 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()
